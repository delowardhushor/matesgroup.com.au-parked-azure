               <p>Our team analyses the responsibility, role and amount of workers required for the job profile and scrutinizes the resumes to find the best suitable candidates. Mates Workforce has access to a number of candidates through our recruitment database. </p>

         <div class="c-l-sec">
               <h3>Skill testing</h3>
               <p>Before we recruit and employ the candidates in the workplace, we feel it is our responsibility to test the skills that the candidates possess. This ensures their ability to perform to the fullest while working. Hence, we shortlist the candidates based on the skills and experience required for the role.</p>

                  <p>We are unique in the way we match candidates to our clients. Without meeting someone face to face you cannot make an accurate assessment of their skills, abilities, attitude, desire, behaviour and passion for the opportunity they are applying for. We have developed a system which describes their attributes and vital understanding of the candidate. This method has proven to be very successful in placing the right person at the right place for the right job.</p>

                  <p>Mates Workforce team performs a face-to-face meeting once candidates match the client's requirements. This is to ensure that the candidate's personality is analysed in-depth for the role, they are compared with credentials of the other candidates and their personal circumstances are known before finalising the job offer.</p>
