                        <li>Secondly, make sure that your recruiter has the potentiality to select the absolute applicant. This task includes:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Answering the questions nicely asked by candidates.</li>
                                <li>Interviewing and screened out the imperfect applicants.</li>
