                    <h3>Interview Questions for Employers</h3>
                    <p>Whenever the candidates are preparing for their job examination, the HR manager should prepare interview questions to judge the strong applicants. A crucial part of the recruiting process is creating a good set of interview questions for employers, helping to find out key information about the strengths, limitations, and personality of an applicant.</p>
                    <p>Our collection of suggested employer interview questions will help you optimize the value of the conference and narrow down the most appropriate applicant for the position on offer. </p>

                    <h2>Interview Questions to Ask Candidates</h2>
                    <h3>Introduce Yourself</h3>
                    <p>For employers, this is a popular initial interview question, and understandably so. It acts as a quick ice-breaker that allows the applicant time to relax but still has the potential to provide useful insights. </p>
                    <p>Although some applicants may provide a review of their career history, others may choose to include new information, such as their long-term career ambitions. Either way, look for applicants who match their answer with the position on offer, noting in particular how the company can add value. Interrogate smartly the applicants when interviewing. </p>

                    <h3>Ask Why You Are Interested to Join in This Organization </h3>
                    <p>This one will recognize those applicants who have done some background research among the potential set of interview questions for employers. The better-prepared applicants would be able to provide personalized answers, share their own view of the growth of the organization, its mission, and values, or provide thoughtful insights into why they find the position attractive. </p>

                    <h3>Explain What Your Strengths Are? </h3>
                    <p>By asking this question you will learn about the applicant’s strengths and potentiality as well as his/her self-criticism power. With this, you can explore the potential and perfectly matched candidates for your company.</p>

                    <h3>Ask About His/Her Weakness Also</h3>
                    <p>While examining a candidate you need to have some conversation on his/her weakness. It is also a part of self-criticism. Candidates enquiring himself/herself finding out the answer to these questions. </p>

                    <h3>Where Do You Like to See Yourself In Five Years? </h3>
                    <p>This is not intended to test the psychic abilities of a candidate. Instead, asking about long-term goals gives a hiring manager an idea of the motivation and career aspirations of an individual and how these support the position and culture of the business.</p>

                    <h3>In Your Next Job, What Are the Most Significant Things You Are Searching For? </h3>
                    <p>Candidates can provide a wide variety of answers to this question, and by searching for what is important to the organization and the position in question, hiring managers may narrow down the best answers. Discussions about being able to broaden personal skill sets, being able to exercise initiative, or taking on more responsibilities may all demonstrate an applicant who is inspired by more than just a pay packet.</p>

                    <h3>Why Are You Going to Quit Your Present Job? </h3>
                    <p>This question should need to be framed with sensitivity when it comes to interview questions for employers. A candidate may have been made redundant, or after taking time to research or raise a family, he may return to the workforce. Whatever the case, before asking the issue, it is worth checking a candidate's resume to show that you are familiar with their circumstances. </p>

                    <h3>What Wage Are You Asking For? </h3>
                    <p>Talk to the interviewee about his/her expected salary/wage. Offer the applicant a consultation. This is also a testing process in an interview.</p>

                    <h3>Have You Got Any Questions That You'd Like to Ask? </h3>
                    <p>Lastly, as a recruiter, you have to end the meeting by questioning that if he/she got any questions that he/she’d like to ask. Through this, you can examine a strong candidate.</p>
                    <p>You have to note down as a reporter what the candidates told during the interview. Be a smart audience of your interviewee. Express him/her about your query also.</p>
