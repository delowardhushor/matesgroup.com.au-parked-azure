                    <p>Innovations have always affected corporations. It had a huge influence when the internet first arrived on the market. Businesses were immediately able to connect around the world with staff and consumers. Then came the mobile Internet and the rise of the cloud, introducing their own improvements. Effective business owners have adapted to the alterations created by new technology. </p>
                    <h3>Some disruptive technologies are impacting your business. For example:</h3>
                    <dl class="row">
                        <dt class="col-xl-3">1. Blockchain Tech</dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">The program behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is Blockchain. It's a worldwide ledger, open to everyone. This ledger manages digital transactions safely and automatically. Information is stored on personal computer networks, so it's decentralized. It's hard for someone with users around the world to corrupt the network or take down the results. </dd>

                        <dt class="col-xl-3">2. 5D Printer </dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">With the advancement of the internet, it is possible to share the blueprint of a product with anyone to be reproduced by a 5D printer anywhere in the world. An advanced manufacturing route that allows synthetic microstructures to be programmed and rendered within a five-dimensional design space. In addition to the 3D shaping capabilities of additive manufacturing, local composition control (+1D) and particle orientation (+1D) are also included in such a design space. 5D printers are commonly used in apparel, vehicles, medical, industry, etc.</dd>

                        <dt class="col-xl-3">3. Machine Learning </dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">Computer scientists have still not built sentient robots, but machine learning is a step in that process. After being exposed to different data, machine learning ensures that computer systems can learn and develop. In essence, this implies that computer systems do not typically need to be programmed and can write software for themselves. Machine learning is being a new broad sector in the engineering sector. A computing system is being developed.</dd>

                        <dt class="col-xl-3">4. Biometric</dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">Biometric authentication may be used to provide improved protection or a more personalized experience to customers. One field where biometrics can cause major changes in the car industry. Future cars, for instance, will be able to recognize who is riding and configure driver assistance settings to match the person. </dd>

                        <dt class="col-xl-3">5. IoT</dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">The Internet of Things (IoT) is the system of recognizable objects and their virtual representations that are inserted with computers, software, sensors, and network communication, such as devices, cars, structures, and various things, which enables these items to collect and share information. There can also be risks, as the connectivity of billions of smart devices can pose a real threat to security. </dd>

                        <dt class="col-xl-3">6. Renewable Energy</dt>
                        <dd class="col-xl-9">Renewable sources such as sunlight, air, water, waves, etc. are used to produce energy, thus reducing the adverse effects on the environment. The benefits of renewable electricity include environmental benefits, safe sources of energy, economic benefits, stable prices of energy, etc. This disruptive technology will enable companies to reduce costs and improve production. </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Due to the development of applied science, engineering science, biotechnology, life becomes changes and those are the disrupting technologies that affect your business.</p>
