                    Warehouse staff plays a big role in
                    Australiaâ€™s economy. Many companies
                    in Sydney and Melbourne want staff for
                    their warehouses. We, the Mates Group company,
                    recruit warehouse labour and provide the selected
                    candidates to our respected client companies.
