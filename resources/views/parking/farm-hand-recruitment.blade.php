                <p style="text-align: center">Farming is a part of agriculture. It started thousands years ago. Eventually, people used domesticated animals such as oxen for ploughing, pulling, and transportation. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. They could use this extra food when crops failed or trade it for other goods. Food surpluses allowed people to work at other tasks unrelated to farming.<br>
